This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



Exercise
• Write a submit script from scratch – The script should use the following parameters:
  • Uses 1 node from the research.q queue
  • Creates a file (called text.txt with content: “I have written a submit script”
  • Sleeps for 30 seconds
  • Lists the contents of the folder
– Submit your script and check the output
– Submit the same job from the command line (i.e. all sbatch options should be added to the command line
together with a script file)
– Do the same without using the script file (i.e. adding a --wrap option)


  
1::: exercise_1.slurm, exercise_1-output, text.txt
2::: sbatch --job-name=exercise_2 --output=exercise_2-output--nodes=1 --partition=research.q exercise_2.slurm
3::: sbatch --job-name=exercise_3 --output=exercise_3-output --nodes=1 --partition=research.q --wrap="echo 'I have written a submit file' > text.txt;sleep 30;ls"

4:::exercise_4.slurm, exercise_4-output, names_0-4.txt

5:::job4_array.slurm, dependencies_array.slurm, basic-job4-output%a,
